The Car Shop Management System is a simple Python program that helps manage a car shop.
It uses lists to store all the data like cars, suppliers, and employees. When you start the program, you will choose a role, Manager or Supplier.

If you choose Manager, you can do different actions like adding a new car, removing a car,
viewing the stock from suppliers, and checking the list of employees.

If you choose Supplier, you can add new car stocks to the inventory. This makes it look like you are supplying cars to the shop.
